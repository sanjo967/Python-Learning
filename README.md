# Python-Learning
This Repository has been created to host the notebooks I create as I go through my journey for learning data science. 
My aim is to document my journey and keep a record of all the notebooks I wokr on as I hone my skills.  
My main source for learning these skills is the IBM Data Science course, Data Camp and AI technologies to facilitate by learning.
